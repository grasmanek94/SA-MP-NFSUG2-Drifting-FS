#summary GPS Plugin Index

= GPS Plugin a.k.a. RouteConnector =

With the help of this plugin you can manage routes on the roades easily, and also manipulate the information.
This plugin is a recommended 'must have' for RP and trucking servers.

== Functions ==

<code language="PAWN"> native AddNode(Float:X,Float:Y,Float:Z,AddToPathFinder = 0);</code><pre>
	Function:
		AddNode
	Description:
		Adds a node into the memory of the plugin,
		This node will be unavailable in route calculations.
	Parameters:
		Position as X Y Z
		AddToPathFinder - if set to 1 it will also make sure the graph will be updated so when searching for a route it will be added to the list.
	Returns the added nodeID, -1 if failed.
	Note:
		NEVER EVER set AddToPathFinder to 1 when a calculation is in progress! THAT IS YOUR OWN RESPOSIBILITY IF IT HAPPENS.

</pre><code language="PAWN"> native AddNodeEx(ID,Float:X,Float:Y,Float:Z,AddToPathFinder = 0);</code><pre>
	Function:
		AddNodeEx
	Description:
		The only difference with AddNode is that you can specify your own NodeID here.
		Gaps may now be present.
	Parameters:
		ID as Custom NodeID
		Position as X Y Z
		AddToPathFinder - if set to 1 it will also make sure the graph will be updated so when searching for a route it will be added to the list.
	Returns the added nodeID, -1 if failed.
	Note:
		NEVER EVER set AddToPathFinder to 1 when a calculation is in progress! THAT IS YOUR OWN RESPOSIBILITY IF IT HAPPENS.
</pre>


<code language="PAWN"> native ConnectNodes(NodeID_one,NodeID_two,AddToPathFinder = 0,direction = 0);</code><pre>

	Function:
		ConnectNodes
	Description:
		This will connect two nodes stored in memory, same rules as for AddNode(Ex), it won't be available in path calculations.
		When you connect NodeID_one with NodeID_two it will automaticly connect the opposite, no distance suplying is needed as the XYZ are supplied at node creation.
	Parameters:
		NodeID_one and NodeID_two as NodeID's
		AddToPathFinder - if set to 1 it will also make sure the graph will be updated so when searching for a route it will be added to the list.
		direction - you can choose to only connect nodeID one with nodeID two (One_To_Two = 1) or to connect them together (BOTH = 0)
	Returns:

		Anything above or equal to 0 means success (the NodeOne[connectid] is retuned), else failure.
	Note:
		NEVER EVER set AddToPathFinder to 1 when a calculation is in progress! THAT IS YOUR OWN RESPOSIBILITY IF IT HAPPENS.

</pre><code language="PAWN"> native WriteNodesToFile(filename[]);</code><pre>

	Function:
		WriteNodesToFile
	Description:
		Write all nodes, connections, contents of the memory into an loadable file,
		can be used by ReadNodesFromFile later.
	Parameters:
		filename -	the "path/filename.extension" to store the information in,
					note that if you want to make a file in the scriptfiles folder you need to supply:
					WriteNodesToFile("scriptfiles/your.file.name");
	Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

</pre><code language="PAWN"> native ReadNodesFromFile(filename[]);</code><pre>

	Function:
		ReadNodesFromFile
	Description:
		Read all nodes, connections, contents of the file into the memory,
		This function will automaticly create nodes, connect them, create the virtual graph to search paths on
		after it has been loaded into the memory.
	Parameters:
		filename -	the "path/filename.extension" to read the information from,
					note that if you want to read a file in the scriptfiles folder you need to supply:
					ReadNodesFromFile("scriptfiles/your.file.name");
	Warning:
		It is not recommended to use this funcion, use at your own risk.
		The plugin calls this function only at server startup, however I have included it for you.
		You still can make aditional nodes with it (if you analyse the project source code correctly, you will know what I mean)
	Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

</pre><code language="PAWN"> native GetNodePos(NodeID,&Float:X,&Float:Y,&Float:Z);</code><pre>

	Function:

	Function:
		CalculatePath
	Description:
		Get the XYZ position of the supplied NodeID
	Parameters:
		Start - The start NodeID
		End - the destination NodeID
		routeID (optional) - [custom integer supply] Here you can specify an integer value that will be passed
		to the callback, along with the calculated path information, for example the PlayerID.
	Note:
		if you will be using the routeID parameter for recognizing routes, make sure they all are unique,
		once started route search cannot be aborted and will just be queued and the callback will still be called.

		This function is Threaded, this means that if the CalculatePath search takes 3 seconds, it won't lagg your server.
		Your server will continue to work normally.

		Only the callback in the script which calls the plugin will get executed with this, if you do CalculatePath in Script1,
		and have your callback in Script2 then it won't get executed

		Returns always 1.
