To run the plugins on a windows SA:MP server 
you need to make sure you have installed all required depencies.
If you encounter any errors please try installing:

-Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package

-Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package



If this still doesn't work try downloading the missing DLL's (search on google) and put them in the directory where you have your samp-server.exe.
